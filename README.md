# GUI-for-Covid-19-Vaccine-Status
The goal is to develop a GUI application to track covid-19 vaccine status and if patient didnâ€™t receive it than it prompt to make an appointment for the covid-19 vaccine. 

Input information: patient identifiers: Patient's name and Date of Birth or License Number

Output: Patient is fully vaccinated (received Booster), Patient is partially vaccinated, patient is not vaccinated. 

This application will use immunization database from doctor's office. Our assumption is that this application will verify patient's vaccine status with the immunization database at doctor's office.
